e.ecoli
galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
It is the main enzmye required to convert galactose to glucose. GALT is controled by the FOXO3 gene.
The lack of this enzyme can be fatal for humans as well. Basically tranfers
galactase into glucose.

acyl-coa synthetase
Acyl-CoA is a group of coenzymes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids.
 It is a temporary compound formed when coenzyme A (CoA) attaches to the end of a long-chain fatty acid inside living cells.
 The compound undergoes beta oxidation, forming one or more molecules of acetyl-CoA.
 This, in turn, enters the citric acid cycle, eventually forming several molecules of ATP.


alcohol dehydrogenase
Alcohol dehydrogenases are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones
 with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ to NADH). In humans and many other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are toxic,
 and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various metabolites.
 In yeast, plants, and many bacteria, some alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the opposite reaction as part of fermentation to ensure a constant supply of NAD+


choline dehydrogenase
Found into mitochondria of the human cell as well as ecoli.
n enzymology, a choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
choline + acceptor =  betaine aldehyde + reduced acceptor
Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choline and acceptor, whereas its two products are betaine aldehyde and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors.
The systematic name of this enzyme class is choline:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase.



alkyl hydroperoxide reductase
The main way that the ecoli is able to get rid of the hydrogen peroxide generated suring aerobic metabolism.
They need this harmful chemical and this protien finds the extra and only leaves the required amount.
Hydrogen peroxide otherwise would damage critical biomolecules.
